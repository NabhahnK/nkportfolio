          My name is Nabhahn Kamaal. I was born and rasied in Tucson, Az. I've
          always wanted to be a programmer and I started the University of
          Arizona full-stack flex bootcamp to do just that. Currently I am a
          Care Giver for United Cerebral Palsy of Southern Arizona. Im hoping to
          use this program to start a career in writing efficient and capable
          programs.
